# Dotfiles: neovim configuration

My config for [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) which I manage via [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

Requires neovim >= 0.5.

You might use this as a starting point or reference but blindly using this repository will probably not work for you.
